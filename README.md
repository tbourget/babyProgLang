# babyProgLang
A very basic and silly interpreted programming language using baby speak as keywords.

# Keywords are defined as follows:
# pee = "+"
# gah = "-"
# milk = "*"
# heh = "/"
# mama = "("
# dada = ")"

# b = 0
# ba = 
# baa = 2
# baaa = 3
# baaaa = 4
# baaaaa = 5
# baaaaaa = 6
# baaaaaaa = 7
# baaaaaaaa = 8
# baaaaaaaaa = 9
